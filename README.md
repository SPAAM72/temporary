# temporary
for internship assesement

Included two csv files internshala.csv is a subset of attempts collection 
file and internshala1.csv is a filtered collection of students attempts number 
and corresponding marks.

Task1 is solved by simple visualization between totalmarks obtained by student and 
total attempts. I assumed practice as number of attempts.

Task3 is implememnted on trimmed version of attempts collection table using Kmeans and Dbscan.
